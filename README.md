# Simplest Frontend

This is a verry simple website that displays the contents of the file
`example.json`. Change the URI from `index.js` or the whole url to whatever resource
you want to show.

You can serve this website with any HTTP server. One possible one is:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

```
$ cd <project directory>
$ http-server .
```
